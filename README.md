Overview
--------
Using a car crash dataset, we analyze the effect that different variables have on car crashes in the US through visual and statistical methods. This project contains the following elements: 

* Density map visualization (country wide) using Plotly express. 
* Random forest model to predict car crash severity
* Tensorflow Keras model to predict car crash severity
* Satistical methods comparing significance of outcomes of select columns from the dataset
